# Smart City Multi-Agent Traffic Optimization

Welcome to the Smart City Simulation Project! This Git repository serves as the home for a sophisticated multi-agent system meticulously crafted to simulate and optimize the intricate operations of a smart city's road network. The project is rich in features and functionalities, covering the following key aspects:

Road Network Simulation: Generate a comprehensive road network featuring buildings, vehicles, and traffic regulators (traffic lights).

Traffic Flow Optimization: Employ intelligent traffic light control strategies citywide to enhance the overall efficiency of traffic flow.

Emergency Response Units: Seamlessly integrate emergency response units such as ambulances, police vehicles, and fire engines into the simulation.
Prioritize the movement of emergency units over regular vehicles to expedite their response times.

Dynamic Priority Assignment: Implement a dynamic priority assignment system for emergency units based on task urgency.
Ensure the highest priority is given to units handling the most critical situations.

Scenario Handling: Manage diverse scenarios, including responses to robberies, fires, and emergency hospital transports.
Adapt traffic flow dynamically based on the nature of each scenario.

Statistical Monitoring: Implement statistical monitoring to track vehicle movements and their arrival times at designated destinations.
